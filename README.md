For my final project I have built a search engine to search for details about airports around the world.

Minimal requirements:

<aside>
ðŸ‘¾ **Technical requirements**

âœ“ Frontend in React

âœ“ Backend in Node.js

âœ“ MongoDB database

âœ“ Navigation using React Router

âœ“ Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari

âœ“ Follow the accessibility guidelines

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸŽ¨ **Visual requirements**

âœ“ Your application should have a clear structure, using the box model as a reference, with consistent margins/paddings.

âœ“ You should use consistent h1-h6 styles and sizes throughout your site and for multiple devices.

âœ“ You should use a colour scheme based on one or a few colours.

âœ“ You should have a design that can be adjusted to fit devices of all sizes. Remember that **58.43%** (Mar 2023) of all users will visit your page from a mobile device and that the page should therefore be optimised for these users too!
